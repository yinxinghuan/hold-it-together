"""Turn the flat-grey sticker bust shots into clean HEAD-ONLY die-cut stickers.

The image model won't reliably honour "no shoulders" — it keeps drawing a bust with
a collar/shirt. So we fix it deterministically instead of fighting the prompt:

  1. color-key the flat grey background (flood-fill from the 4 corners). Because the
     model draws a closed white border, ~bg is already a SOLID, hole-free silhouette
     of the whole bust (interior gaps aren't connected to the outside).
  2. find the NECK = the narrowest row below the head; if the silhouette re-widens
     below it (shoulders/shirt), crop everything below the neck.
  3. crop to the head bbox, keep the original art pixels, and grow a uniform white
     sticker border around the cut (covers the flat neck edge so it reads as a head).
  4. recenter into a transparent square so the engine's drawImage stays centered.

Re-runnable: pristine originals are stashed in public/tiers/_raw/.
